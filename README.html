<h2>privy-daemon</h2>

<p><code>privy-daemon</code> is a server which needs to be running for messages to be sent or recieved. Ideally this process is always running to maximize the chances of receiving an incoming message.</p>

<p>A message in the send-queue is kept there until successfully received by the other peer. Successful reception of a message requires the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Sending party encrypts the message and randomly generated keyphrase using the public key of the receiving party</p></li>
<li><p>Receiving party decrypts the message body and keyphrase.</p></li>
<li><p>Receiving party hashes the message body and sends it back to the sender.</p></li>
<li><p>Sender checks that hash matches expectation, if so the send is a success.</p></li>
</ol>
